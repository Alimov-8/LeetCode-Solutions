## Python 3
### In this Repository I would like to share my solutions to the LeetCode questions.

I will provide comments to each code for being more understandable to read code 💬

- After participating in Asia to Japan (Coding contest) 2020 🏆🎟 , I understood that I need to make more practise in LeetCode :)
I can recommend you too, if you wanna solve with me in a team (direct me via telegram)
